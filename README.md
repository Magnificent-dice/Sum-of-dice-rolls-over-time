# Sum-of-dice-rolls-over-time
This repository covers the python code I made to automatically model the results of a series of dice rolls. Originally designed for my homebrewed d&amp;d naval battle system this code generates the chances of getting specific sums from rolling pools of dice. It comes in multiple forms for multiple kinds of results modelling.
